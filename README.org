* Ants Simulation in Clojure

** Motivation

Learn about Clojure's concurrency strategies and refactor the original code from
Rich's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGVqrGmwOAw][talk about concurrency in Clojure]].

** Running the simulation

This project uses the [[https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli][clojure CLI]] and =make= tools to build and execute the
application. It has been tested with OpenJDK 11. Simply call =make= to run it
and =make test= to run all the unit tests.

#+begin_example sh
make
make test
#+end_example

You can also run it using Docker (tested with v20.10.x), but I've only tested it
in a GNU/Linux distribution, hence macOS and Windows are not supported.

#+begin_example sh
make docker/build
make docker/run/release
#+end_example

You can remove the container and image with:

#+begin_example sh
make docker/clean
#+end_example
